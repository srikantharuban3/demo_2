 1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this document is to specify the functional and non-functional requirements of the ParaBank online banking website. It will serve as the basis for design, development, testing, and acceptance of the system. 1.2 Scope The website allows customers to perform banking operations online via a web user interface, including login, registration, account management, transfers, bill payments, deposits/withdrawals, view history, etc. It also provides informational pages (About Us, Services, Locations, Contact Us) for public visitors. 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations User / Customer = someone who has or wants a bank account and uses the website. Admin = internal bank staff who manage user accounts and system. ATM Services = online equivalents for withdraw/transfer/check balances/make deposits. Bill Pay = paying third-party bills via the system. Session = logged in period of user. 1.4 References The live site landing page and navigation structure. (see homepage) Applicable standards (web security, usability guidelines, banking regulations). 1.5 Overview The remainder of this document details user-roles, overall system description, specific functional requirements, non-functional requirements (performance, usability, security, etc.), constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria. 2. Overall Description 2.1 Product Perspective The website is a web-based banking portal integrated with the bankâ€™s back-end systems (account database, transaction processing, billers interface). It is a replacement or enhancement of existing online banking portals. 2.2 Product Functions High-level functions include: Customer registration &amp; profile management Secure login/log-out Viewing account balances and history Transferring funds (internal/external) Deposits and withdrawals (via online interface) Bill payment module Informational pages: About Us, Services, Products, Locations, Contact Us Forgot login information recovery Admin interface (for bank staff) 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics Customer (Registered user) : has login credentials, uses full set of banking features. Guest (Public visitor) : can browse informational pages, register for account, but cannot access secured banking operations. Administrator/Bank Staff : manage users/accounts, monitor transactions, manage system settings. 2.4 Operating Environment Web browser support (modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile) Server environment: web server + application server + database server (details to be defined). 2.5 Design &amp; Implementation Constraints Must comply with banking security regulations (e.g., encryption, authentication, transaction logging). Data privacy and GDPR/other regional compliance. Performance requirements: pages should load within an acceptable time. Availability requirement: system should be available 24Ã—7 with scheduled maintenance windows. 2.6 User Documentation &amp; Help Online help or FAQ section (e.g., â€œForgot login info?â€) Contact Us page with support details. 2.7 Assumptions &amp; Dependencies Assumes reliable internet connectivity for users.
